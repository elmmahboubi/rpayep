      "content": "Honestly, I was super nervous about buying a used camera online. I’m a broke college student and needed something for my photography class, but didn’t wanna spend a fortune. This one showed up two days before my first assignment (I was sweating, not gonna lie). There’s a tiny scuff near the shutter button, but who cares? I took it out to shoot my friend’s band in a dark basement and the pics came out way better than my phone ever could. Battery lasted through the whole night, too. For the price, I’m honestly shocked. Would do it again.",

      "content": "So, I bought this right before a trip to Joshua Tree because my old camera died (RIP). I was a little skeptical, but honestly, it looks almost new. There’s a tiny ding on the corner, but you’d have to squint to see it. Took some sunrise shots and the colors popped. The only thing is, the box was kinda beat up when it arrived, but the camera itself was fine. Saved a bunch of cash and still got awesome photos of my dog climbing rocks.",

      "content": "I just started getting into photography (mostly for fun, nothing serious), and picked this up after my friend recommended it. It was packed up well and ready to go out of the box. I took it to a food truck festival and got some cool shots of my tacos—colors looked great, even in weird lighting. The only thing is, the touchscreen is a little smudgy, but I just wiped it off. Not a big deal. Overall, happy I didn’t splurge on something new.",

      "content": "Shipping was fast—like, I blinked and it was at my door. I’ve bought used stuff before and sometimes it’s a gamble, but this camera felt solid right away. No manual in the box (not a huge deal, I just googled it), but everything else looked untouched. Took it out for some street shots in Chicago and it handled the weird March weather like a champ. The strap was a little frayed, but I swapped it for my old one. Would definitely buy here again.",

      "content": "So I almost didn’t buy this—been burned on used gear before. But I’m glad I did. The G7X came bubble-wrapped like crazy and looked barely touched. First thing I did was snap a pic of my dog to check if it worked—super sharp. Only thing is, the battery drains a little faster than I hoped, but I just bought a backup and it’s fine. For what I paid, I’m honestly impressed.",

      "content": "Picked this up for my YouTube channel because my old camera was just too bulky. This one’s way lighter, which is awesome for walking around NYC. The flip screen is super handy, but I wish it was a little brighter in sunlight. Also, the Wi-Fi setup took me a minute to figure out (not super techy, tbh). Still, I filmed a whole day in Central Park and the footage looked crisp—even caught a squirrel stealing my pretzel, lol. Would recommend if you want something easy to carry.",
